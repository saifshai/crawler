# crawler
this repo contains my experimentation with BeautifulSoup with the intention of ending with a crawler that will
be used to crawl SSENSE's website to collect a number of links that fit the parameters given. Some of this repo is inspired by Allen Downey's "Data Structures and Information Retrieval in Python"
